Welcome ;) I go by handle **DarkKing**, but in real life I am a red teamer, security researcher and overall system buster. Apart from Bachelor's in Computer Science and Masters in Cyber Security, I have few years of experience now in the cyber field starting from a software dev, going to SOC analyst and finally a penetration tester. You will usually find me in conferences or popping boxes in HackTheBox. 

Got an interesting project for me? Need some cyber help within your team? Drop me a message at **inquiry** [at] **darkking** [dot] **dev**.
